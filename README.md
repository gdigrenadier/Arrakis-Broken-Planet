# Arrakis: Broken Planet
A mod for Rusted Warfare, a RTS game that is essentially modding heaven (https://store.steampowered.com/app/647960/Rusted_Warfare__RTS/).

Arrakis: Broken Planet (or ABP for short) is a mega mod based off Westwood's original Dune games (DUNE II, Dune 2000, Emperor: Battle For Dune) with some extra features and things from Westwood's Command & Conquer franchise. It features many units from across the games while keeping DUNE II's simplistic artstyle.

# HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED TO INSTALL THE MOD IN ITS CURRENT STATE!
At the moment, Arrakis Broken Planet is not at all properly functional, with many, many problems still in the mod. Heck, its not even at a proper ready for release state. I highly recommend waiting until a release has been made, as those hopefully run much more stable with less bugs appearing. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

# How To Install

Mobile:
 - Download the latest release, open the game and use the "Import New Mod" button on the mods menu to add ABP to your game. Once done, enable ABP on the mod menu.

PC:
 - Download the latest release, open Steam and right click on Rusted Warfare in the list of games on your library. Hover your cursor over the "Manage" button and then select "Browse local files". This should bring up your Rusted Warfare game files. If so, open the folder called "mods" and then select the folder called "units" inside it. This is where you should put ABP inside. Once done, enable ABP on the mod menu.
 - WARNING: Highly recommended to run the mod only in the 64 bit version of the game, as it may be unstable on the 32 bit version. You can make Steam open Rusted Warfare in  64 bit by selecting "Play Rusted Warfare (64bit)" and then clicking the "Always use this option" tick box and then pressing "Play".
 - (This may subject to change, as I may release the mod on the Steam Workshop in the future.)
